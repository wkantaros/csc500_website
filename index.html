      <p>
        &emsp; Computer science embraces problem solving, hardware, algorithms, and perspectives that help people utilize computers to address real-world problems in contemporary life. As the study of computer science is evolving, the careful design of the AP Computer Science A course and exam continues to strive to engage a diverse student population, including female and underrepresented students, with the rigorous and rewarding concepts of computer science. Students who take the AP Computer Science A course and exam are well prepared to continue their study of computer science and its integration into a wide array of computing and STEM-related fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; The AP Computer Science A curriculum provides resources, such as application-related labs, that connect with students with diverse interests, particularly female and underrepresented student populations. The course is engaging and underscores the importance of communicating solutions appropriately and in ways that are relevant to current societal needs. Thus, a well-designed, modern AP Computer Science A course can help address traditional issues of equity, access, and broadening participation in computing while providing a strong and engaging introduction to fundamental areas of the discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; The AP Computer Science A course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; The AP Computer Science A course curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities. Some colleges and universities may organize their curricula in alternative ways, so that the topics of the AP Computer Science A course are spread over several college courses, with other topics from computer science interspersed.
